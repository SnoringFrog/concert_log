Birds in Row is a hardcore band from France. During their set, someone asked where they play in France. The vocalist seemed a bit confused by the question at first. He answered something like "in clubs" or "at shows", something generic like that. The crowd member asked about specific venues, saying that when they were in Paris they couldn't find any music like this. Vocalist said "well if you're ever back in Paris, let us know and we'll point you in the right direction."

Then, during Listener's set, while they were tuning between songs, Dan asked if anyone had any questions. It seemed like a joke in reference to the previous set, but it led to this exchange (paraphrased as best as I can recall):

Crowd member: How do you feel about Richmond?
Dan: How do I feel about Irishmen?
CM: No, Richmond!
Dan: Oh, I like Richmond. Let's not get into how I feel about Irishmen.
CM: Well, we like you too. *pause* Richmond, I mean. I can't speak for Irishmen.
