July wrap up! Just 5 more months in this backlog until I'm caught up.

July was one of those months that happened. Nothing too crazy.

Shows in July: 14
Shows in 2016 so far: 85

Notable new bands to me: Night Verses, Ella Vader, Harm

Best show: letlive, no question there.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Thanks to traffic, I missed Black Pages at Strange Matter, which was lame. Also missed most of Born Hollow's set for stupid stuff.

Creepiest song: that song Wandcarver has about sacrificing a child...it's just weird. Can't really say I ever wanted to hear that again (spoiler: I did a few months later).

Show that made me want to hurt my friends: Born Hollow had the absolute most obnoxious 3-track loop before their set that I had to hear too many times and Luke I wanted to hurt you all.
