November wrap up!

I got a new job in November, and I had a full week of nothing to do before I started there, so I took a quick little 10k mile trip through the midwest. Got a little delayed by some ice in Kansas City, so I didn't quite make it to Utah, but since that resulted in a cool day hanging out with Grey & Associates in KC and seeing a show at Parker, I'd say it was more of a perk than a setback. 

Also, for the first time ever, I saw a show on my birthday. I've been trying to see a show on every calendar date, and after this month, there's only 7 dates remaining: Jan 1, Jul 30, Nov 25, and Dec 23-26 (spoiler alert: I didn't get any of the Dec/Jan dates as they came by)

Shows in November: 16
Shows in 2019 so far: 116

Notable new artists to me: Empty, Humbird, The Woodpile, Bent Knee, Thank You Scientist

Best show: Lantern Fest. Good friends, good music, free food. Can't ask for much more than that.

Shows I was bummed to miss: The Last Bison in Richmond (I was maybe a mile away lol), Keep Flying in Richmond, and Sleepy Tyrant in Richmond

Most boring drive: Kansas City to Laramie, WY. I had to drive across the entirety of Nebraska. One of the most exciting things I saw there was a hill with a hill on top of it. Also the wind was pretty crazy there.

Quickest visit: I was only in Lawrence, KS for about 12 hours, and that includes 2, 2-3 hour naps.

Other random facts/stats:
This month was my first time at 5 of the 13 venues I went to.
This month was my first time seeing 33 of the 72 bands I saw perform live.
