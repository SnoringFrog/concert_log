December wrap up!

Finally. Caught up with my backlog of monthly posts, now I can get to that 2019 post (and perhaps a post for the decade?). Lots of metal this month, which makes sense for Christmas spirit and all that, right?

Shows in December: 9
Shows in 2019 so far: 125

Notable new artists to me: Down with Rent, Flood the Asylum, Monochromatic Black, Organ Trail

Best show:  Mongrels/Flood the Asylum/et al in Fredericksburg. I've missed Mongrels.

Worst parade: So, I wasn't aware the show in Fredericksburg was the same day as the Christmas parade, or that the Rec Center was giong to be surrounded by the parade. That made getting there a bit difficult, and so I have decided I hate parades.

Best new friend: That person whose name I never got and who I never really got a good look at at West Beach Tavern. Hope your new job is going well, whoever you are.
