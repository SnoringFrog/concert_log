October wrap up!

Not a ton of highlights, but overall a solid month. 

Shows in October: 15
Shows in 2016 so far: 133

Notable new bands to me: Poncho Model, Polyenso (well, new live; I've known their music for a while), Barons

Best show: Alestorm was a ton of fun, and both Polyenso shows were stellar

Shows I was bummed to miss: Nothing springs to mind since I took forever to post this lol.

Weirdest thing to remind me of a band: "Oh, this is that child sacrifice song. Thought these guys seemed familiar."

Band I really wanted a t-shirt from then was really bummed they had none: Poncho Model.
