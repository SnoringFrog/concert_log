December wrap up!

I was almost caught up with these, and then I just dropped the ball on them again. In other news, while compiling this, I realized I'd entirely forgotten that I ever saw Milky Chance. Weird. 

Shows in December: 16
Shows in 2016: 164

Notable new bands to me: Suicide Season, Boxford, Chloe Wallace

Best show: Dream Theater.

Almost Coldest show: Chloe Wallace/Christian Welch/Kevin Schelereth/Chris Bernstorf at Two and Ghost. Heat wasn't working until about 30 minutes before the show, so we could all see our breath inside. 

Worst dumb fan moment: Walking from dinner to Speakertree for the TSOW show, I inadvertenly ended up following a couple guys for a bit. They eventually turned and asked me if I was going to the show. I replied I was, they said they were also, which is when I said something like "yeah I had a feeling with the vests and the TSOW patch that you had to be headed that way." As we continued talking on the way to the venue, I found out they were both from TSOW. I've seen them play several times, and still managed not to recognize them. #fail.
