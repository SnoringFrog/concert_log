September wrap up!

Once again, bookended the month with long-distance trips. Started with the latter half of my west coast trip, and ended with a quick weekend trip to MO/IL (speaking of which, St. Louis pizza is great, their ribs are all right, and driving to/from there on a normal weekend is rough even with two people splitting the drive; I do not recommend trying it lol). By the end of this month, the total number of states I'd seen a show in 37 states (and 2 provinces).

Shows in September: 13
Shows in 2019 so far: 92

Notable new artists to me: Sophia Hernandez, Chris Farren, The Last Ten Seconds of Life
