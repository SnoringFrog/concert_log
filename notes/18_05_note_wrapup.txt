May wrap up!

May was a little crazy. First, Two and Ghost had it's final show. A few days later I was in PA for Jayfest/Flood City Fest, and then for Memorial Day weekend I did a trip through Vermont/New Hampshire/Maine--none of which I'd been to before (and with that, I've passed the halfway point: 26 states down, 24 to go). 

This month, after 21 shows, Two and Ghost sadly came to an end. Always wanted to be able to host house shows, so landing in a perfect spot to so was amazing. Thanks to everyone who played at or came to a 2&G show (even you people who for some reason thought it was a good idea to start a mosh pit in a packed living room). Cops showed up a few times, and were always cool and never shut us down. All in all it was a great run. Definitely going to miss that spot, can't wait to get something else started.

Best show: Flood City Fest, without a doubt. Even if you ignore all the music, it was still an absolutely worthwhile trip.
