February wrap up!

February was...February. Nothing too out of the ordinary here. Apparently I looked lonely/depressed at a couple of these shows (Goldfish and Broccoli Samurai, specifically), since on two occasions some completely random person came to console me haha. One told me that 'whatever girl made me feel like this wasn't worth it' and that they could tell I was a great guy, and the other kept coming over and forcing me to smile before she'd leave me alone. Can't really be irked, because they meant well, but it was weird.

Shows in February: 17
Shows in 2018 so far: 29

Notable new artists to me: I the Victor, Sine Cura, Invaluable

Best show: Lights

Shows I was bummed to miss: Tiny Moving Parts in Richmond, Big Gigantic in Raleigh, Harms Way in Richmond, and Advent in MD

Weirdest thing on stage: Pretty much the entirety of Reptaliens and STRFKR fit this bill. Their weird masked dancer wearing a cape and feeding a banana to someone in the crowd might take the cake though. Just having a handful of dancing astronauts/aliens doesn't really measure up to that.
