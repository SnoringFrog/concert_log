-------------
June wrap-up!

Still behind on these, but I'll get there.

This month had a lot of intersting stuff mixed in: first show I ever booked (Link Room), some big fights (during Heavens Die and Advent), an oddly well-timed power outage (at the end of Levi the Poet), a musical (Evil Dead), a chorus of meows (during Kept on Hold). Definitely an interesting month. 

Shows in June: 17
Shows so far in 2016: 71

Notable new bands to me: Pyotr, Born Sick, Eaves

Best show: Really hard call for this month, gonna call it a toss up between Levi the Poet and Ellie Goulding.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Can't recall any offhand for that far back, but I'm sure there was something.
