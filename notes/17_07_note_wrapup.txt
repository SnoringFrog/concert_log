July wrap up!

I'm apparently still chronologically challenged from the insanity that was May: I felt like this was a slow month, but it was definitely above average yet again. Maybe one day I'll have a better gauge of what constitutes 'slow' again (probably not).

Shows in July: 17
Shows in 2017 so far: 127

Notable new artists to me: theLionhearted, Some Say Ghosts, Elephant Jake, Big Mama Shakes, Broken Teeth, Joshua Eadie, Sheldon Cole

Best show: Food and Friends tour in Norfolk. Awesome time, awesome music, awesome food, awesome people.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Circa Survive in Richmond, Vertica at Josie House (I have missed Vertica WAY too many times), a couple local Mosquito Caberet shows, and Embracer/Harm in Greensboro

Worst milkshake: Chicken nuggets and honey -- just don't try this

Wettest show: Down to Nothing in the Warehouse. That show was 85% sweat, at least

Most art displaced?: Ok so this was weird to cram into a made up category, but when Big Mama Shakes was playing at Corner Gallery, pretty much every piece of art on the walls ended up tilted from the vibrations of the music. It's one of those things I found amusing (or irritating? or concerning?) that's probably not an interesting story to tell so I'm sorry you took the time to read about it.

Other random facts/stats:
