January wrap up!

Trying out a new format to the show listing notes. I think it makes more sense, and it's a lot closer to how I list the shows in my records anyways. Not really sure why I've stuck with that other format so long.

Shows in January: 11
Shows in 2019 so far: 11

Notable new artists to me: Hepburn, Dear Heart, Justin Cole, Shame Spiral, Fever 333

Best show: Split between the two Food and Friends shows. Chris doing his set in the bathroom in RVA was great, and getting to just hang out with everyone all night in Fredericksburg was invaluable.

Best band I'd technically seen before but I kinda forgot I'd seen them before but they were really good so I need an excuse to mention them in this post so I've made this long-windedly-named category: Padfoot
