April wrap up!

April was cool.

Shows in April: 13
Shows in 2018 so far: 57

Notable new artists to me: Honeysuckle, Kameron Barton, Franni Rae Cash, Rosemont, Hail the Sun, Bit Brigade

Best show: Honeysuckle/Ian Randall Thornton - Ian encouraged the crowd to shout out any questions/comments/etc they had. That casual, open air persisted into Honeysuckle's set and made an already intimate show that much more unique and personal.

Most unexpected throwback: Your Chance to Die - I originally found them back in Jr. High on Myspace, mostly lost track of them until this month when they popped up on a show in Norfolk.
