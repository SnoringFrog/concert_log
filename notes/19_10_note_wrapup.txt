October wrap up!

Yet another 8-show month. Also, this month I accidentally broke my record for the longest I had gone without seeing a show since late 2014: 12 days (technically I went that long without seeing a show in Sept 2014 as well, but that was right when I started going to shows more frequently, so I've never really counted it). Getting laid off apparently had me too distracted looking for a job to bother slipping into even a single show for a couple weeks, whoops.

At least a quarter of these shows featured live brass, which is cool.

Shows in October: 8
Shows in 2019 so far: 100

Notable new artists to me: Keep Flying, Sepengard, Gone In April, Korplikanni, SeeYouSpaceCowboy

Best show: Eluveitie, easily [talk about weird people in the pit].

Shows I was bummed to miss: Lacey Sturm

Best Nickelback cover: Vacation Manor
