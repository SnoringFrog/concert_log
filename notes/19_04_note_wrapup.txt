April wrap up!

So, I was working on the May wrap-up, then noticed that I never actually did a wrap-up for April. Whoops. Despite me apparently forgetting it happened, it was a pretty good month for shows.

Shows in April: 10
Shows in 2019 so far: 41

Notable new artists to me: I the Mighty, Rebekah Rafferty and the Wakes, Earth Groans, Kississippi

Best show: All of these shows were pretty good this month, so it's a close race, but probably Oh Sleeper/Earth Groans in Raleigh

Shows I was bummed to miss: Of Montreal in RVA, Downhaul's CD release, and Sleepy Tyrant in RVA
