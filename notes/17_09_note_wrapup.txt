September wrap up!

Man, it's surprising how quickly I start getting behind on these. Anyhow, September was a good month. First time in a while I've taken a decent roadtrip and knocked some states off of my list (CT, MA, RI). On top of that, had a good blend of small and large shows for the month. This is also the earliest in the year I've ever passed 150 shows. In 2016, that didn't happen until November, and it never quite happened in 2015. This year has been crazy, apparently.

And not that it's visible to anyone reading this on FB, but I finally reworked some of the scripts I wrote to calculate some of these stats. Putting these wrap-ups together is much faster now, although I do still need to automate counting how many bands/venues were new to me in a given month. I've got a rough shell of that script written, just need to actually sit down and work on it.

Shows in September: 21
Shows in 2017 so far: 163

Notable new artists to me: Copilot, Make American Skate Again, Hello Atlantic, Mile Twelve, Sleave, Gouge Away, Single Mothers

Best show: Even though I had to leave early, probably Charmer/Joy/Black Mask. Either that or the RI "Pop Punk Pajama Pizzalooza" show. There was free pizza (can't get more pop punk than that), and RI pop punk is cool.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Big Something in VB and Emarosa in Richmond

Other random facts/stats:
