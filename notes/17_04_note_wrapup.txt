April wrap up!

Finally caught up on these! After falling behind back in March/April 2016, it's taken me a bit to catch up. Now, we'll see if I can manage to not fall so terribly far behind again. April was a solid month for old favorites, but I didn't come across too many new bands that really grabbed me, sadly.

Shows in April: 16
Shows in 2017 so far: 61

Notable new bands to me: OutSheep, Anchor the Airship, SUSTO, Tall Tall Trees, Kishi Bashi

Best show: Even with the various weather-induced problems, I think Lynchstock takes the cake for April.

Shows I was bummed to miss: United Blood in Richmond, Poured Out in Fayetteville, Someone Just Like You in Lynchburg, Andrew McMahon and the Wilderness at NorVa, and Chasing Victory in Florida
