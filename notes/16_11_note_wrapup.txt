November wrap up!

Well, I didn't catch up on posting these before the end of January like I hoped. Oh well. I'm getting there.

Shows in November: 15
Shows in 2016 so far: 148

Notable new bands to me: Riviera, Emarosa, Less Than Jake, Naysayer

Best show: hard call between Emarosa, Less than Jake, and TSSF in VB

Shows I was bummed to miss: Can't recall anything offhand from that far back.

Most candy: Obsolete Man...not that they have any competition there
