September wrap up!

This is the first month since May '17 that at least half the venues I went to were new to me. It's also the first month since March '16 that I went to less than 10 shows. Thanks to Labor Day, I got to cross two more states off of my list (IN and KY), so there's now just 22 states left that I haven't seen a show in. On a related note, turns out I really like Indianapolis. Got to check out spots like Bluebeard, Tappers Arcade Bar, Garfield Park Conservatory, Delicia, and The Libertine Liquor Bar, all of which were great. If only Indy wasn't so far from basically anywhere else I ever end up - _ -

Shows in 2018 so far: 118

Notable new artists to me: Kayak Jones, Sub-Radio, DRMCTHR

Best show: As Cities Burn. (Though Sub-Radio's a close second just based on how instantly hooked I was on their work)
