November wrap up!

Another "slow" month for me, and yet another month when I just barely kept my streak of going to a new venue every month alive (thanks Syphony of the Goddesses! lol). This month I was also reminded of how great Comrades' Lone Gray's album art is, as the hoodie with that art on it is one of the rare pieces of merch I have that seems to draw comments from people who don't know the band at all. It's also the reason I feel compelled to try and keep a Comrades elevator pitch ready haha. This time, it was in the bathroom at the mewithoutYou/Pianos Become the Teeth show; the guy told me he'd check them out because, "I trust your taste in music, since you're here at this show." I like his simple logic there.

Shows in November: 11
Shows in 2017 so far: 193

Notable new artists to me: The FoxSmiths, Loyals, The Aces, Darlington

Best show: TSSF/Turnstile/Drug Church at Shakas. That show was wild. It was so good I bought two tickets! (Ok maybe that was just because I'm dumb and forgot I already had one...) Honorable mention to the insanity that was the Dead and Dreaming show at Pourhouse.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Knuckle Puck/Movements in Richmond (don't remember how I missed that; it's rare I'll pass up a Movements show), Take Hold Fest (one day I'll get there...)

Most potted plants tossed: Dead and Dreaming

Most blood on covered pool tables: Dead and Dreaming
