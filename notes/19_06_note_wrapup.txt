June wrap up!

Falling behind on these wrap ups again because everytime I have time to write them, I don't feel like actually sitting down and diong it. June wasn't anything too crazy. Accidentally rediscovered a Raleigh venue I'd been to back in 2013, almost fell asleep as a fest, watched a guy play a piece of glass then shatter it on his head -- you know, all the normal stuff. Oh, and I finally made it to Statesville for a show (I'm still not sure how that took this long).

Shows in June: 11
Shows in 2019 so far: 60

Notable new artists to me:
Cuzco, Bracewar, Micah Kimber, Split Wrist

Best show: This is a tough call. There were great individual sets (Emarosa, Comrades, Irae, Sub-Radio) but I'm not sure which show as a whole wins out. I'm going to have to say Stateville though, I think.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Comrades/Bloom in Harrisonburg (stupid rain/traffic), I the Victor in Garner, The Felons in Lynchburg/Harrisonburg, 21 Pilots in Charlottesville, ADTR in Richmond, Lucy Dacus/Deau Eyes in Richmond

Best shoe tying: Someone tied Ben's shoe for him during Irae's set.

Best missed lines: Emarosa was playing a slower song when someone in the crowd decided to cheer "yes, bitch!" Vocalist tried to hold it together, but ended up missing several lines because he couldn't stop laughing.

Best gang vocals: Maybe not technically part of the show, but everyone screaming the Spongebob theme on the way to Sheetz after the Statesville show.
