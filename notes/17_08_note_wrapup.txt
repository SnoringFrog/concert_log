August wrap up!
Well, it finally happened. I've now seen two bands with identical names. Kinda shocked it took this long, but there's a Currents from CT and one from NC that I've seen, which threw off some of the scripts I use to calculate some of these stats at first.
Also, this marks 3 years since I started more actively going to shows. In those 3 years, I've been all up and down the east coast (working on getting further west) and met a plethora of great people. In my life (as f 9/1/17) I've been to 566 shows, 511 of them were between 9/1/14 and 9/1/17. Slight increase in show frequency there haha. It's been insane, but I've loved it.

Shows in August: 15
Shows in 2017 so far: 142

Notable new artists to me: Colin Phils, South Hill Banks, Exit Emergency, Stars Hollow, Fox and the Bear, Heartland Nomads, LA Dies, Eidola, Wesley Montgomery

Best show: Every King and Commoner/Downhaul/Find Me Alive - Super fun house show. 

Shows I was bummed to miss: Ian Randall Thorton record release in Norfolk, Venomspitter/Charmer/Accident Prone in Richmond, Cody Woody in NC.
