2018 wrap up!

[intro/summary]
Compared to 2017, 2018 felt a bit more relaxed in regards to the number of shows I attended, but it did fall more in line with previous years (not that there are many full years worth comparing to). Last year I saw 212 shows, in 2016 it was 164, and in 2015 it was 158 (2014 was 52, but I only really started going to many shows around September that year). That actually makes 2018 the slowest full year since I started attending shows more regularly. There's no particular reason why that stands out to me, but maybe I'm overlooking something *shrug*. Guess we'll see how the numbers play out for 2019.

I went to more new states this year than I think I've ever done before (8). Also, this was the first time I flew out for a trip based primarily around shows (going through AZ, NV, and CA before flying back home from AZ). With any luck, I'll be doing that again this coming year, as I've still got a number of states left to see shows in.

In the first half of the year, Austin and I got to host 7 shows at Two and Ghost before we had to move out, bringing our final total to 21 shows hosted there. Definitely sad to see that go; TAG is easily one of the coolest things I've done. Loved finally being in a good position to offer something to the DIY community that means so much to me. Hopefully, I'll be back in good spot to do that again. I miss it.

The rest of this is going to be a long post with various stats and highlights from the year. Do yourself a favor and check out some of the bands that get mentioned.
