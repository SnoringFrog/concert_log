January wrap up!

Starting off the year well by already being close to a month behind on these wrap up posts. Whoops. (Not that that's anything new)

At the beginning of the month, I nearly broke my record for the most days I've gone without a show (since Oct 2014, which is when I started regularly attending shows) -- 9 days. This was narrowly avoided by going to some random place I'd never heard of in NC on the 9th, which also kept my streak of always going to at least one new venue per month alive.


Shows in January: 12
Shows in 2018 so far: 12

Notable new artists to me: American Lions, Gin War, Turbo Mansion

Best show: Enter Shikari

Shows I was bummed to miss: My Heart My Anchor in Fredericksburg, Jordan Coley in Harrisonburg

Best fire alarm: Fire alarm went off during Enter Shikari, so we all had to go outside and wait for the fire department to show up and confirm things were cool. Other than the delay it didn't seem to affect the show though, at least.

Other random facts/stats:
This month was my first time at 2 of the 9 venues I went to.
This month was my first time seeing 25 of the 45 bands I saw perform live.
Avg shows per week for 2018: 3.00
Days/shows ratio so far for 2018: 2.58:1
Approximate avg shows per month since birth: 2.10
Avg shows per month since Sept '14: 14.46
