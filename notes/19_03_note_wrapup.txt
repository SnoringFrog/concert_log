March wrap up!

This isn't really relevant to March specifically, but I was checking some random numbers in my stats and it turns out that, ignoring the 29th-31st (since not all months have them), I most often go to shows on the 9th of the month (34 times), and least often on the 4th of the month (18 times). (I've been to shows on the 31st of any month just 17 times).

Shows in March: 9
Shows in 2019 so far: 31

Notable new artists to me: Stephanie, Splintercat, Bravely

Best show: Meredith Rd house show. Tiny, intimate show with some really talented acoustic artists.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Fighting Jamesons in VB (I was actually at the show, but had to leave before they played), Dropkick Murphys in RVA

Other random facts/stats:
This month was my first time at 4 of the 9 venues I went to.
This month was my first time seeing 17 of the 27 bands I saw perform live.
Avg shows per week for 2019: 2.38
Days/shows ratio so far for 2019: 2.90:1
Approximate avg shows per month since birth: 2.55
