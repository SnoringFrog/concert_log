December wrap up!

Despite the amount of traveling I did, this was a slow month for shows. But, I spent a week out in the American southwest, and another week around NC for Christmas. Of 8 shows I went to, only half were even in VA (and no other state had more than 1 show), so I think that excused my low numbers lol. I'll get to a yearly wrap up soon enough (hopefully before January's over).

Shows in December: 8
Shows in 2018 so far: 152

Notable new artists to me: Abby Huston, Amoras Bane, Liv Slingerland, WARGIRL

Best show: Toss up between Liv Slingerland/WARGIRL in CA and MYMA in MD.

Shows I was bummed to miss: There was too much in VA while I was gone. I don't feel like looking them all up to list them though.
