Notable new bands to me: On the Cinder, Nicole Dollaganger, Youth Code, Code Orange, Every Time I Die, Patrick Bates, That 1 Guy

Best show: Every Time I Die at Shakas. Packed, crazy. Not much more to it than that.

Shows I was bummed to miss: Divebomb at Charlie's, Moose Blood in Richmond, Deafheaven/This Will Destroy You in Richmond, Thousand Foot Krutch in Norfolk (I was at the show, but just late enough to miss them), The Fritz in VB, and Katatonia in DC (which I somehow missed after looking forward to it for months).
