August wrap up!

Pulled a 3-show day this month. Kind of a stretch for the show at Wasserhund, as I wasn't there terribly long (4-5 songs maybe), but still. Not something I get to try and do very often (this is only the 2nd or 3rd time I've done it, from what I recall).

Shows in August: 17
Shows in 2016 so far: 102

Notable new bands to me: Gardens, Donovan Wolfington, Drug Church, The Record Collection, Christian Welch, Formerly Bodies, Enamity

Best show: Gonna have to say Donovan Wolfington and Drug Church. Great music, fun inter-song banter from Drug Church.

Shows I was bummed to miss: No idea for this month.

Best tv shows: i fight vampires, who provided two shows playing on his laptop in case you didn't want to watch him lol.
