December Wrap up!

Considering I had to work around taking a week-long break for Christmas and briefly having pneumonia, I still got to a surprising number of shows.

Shows in December: 10
Shows in 2015: 157

Notable new bands to me: Divebomb, Incited, Decoys, Kevin Putnam, Many Rooms, Dogwood Tales, Ruin
Best Show: Definitely the Ugly Christmas Sweatour stop in Harrisonburg. Great show all around, especially with Dogwood Tales (they're why Harrisonburg beat out the Richmond stop, hands down)

Shows I was bummed to miss: Hot Basic's final show (missed Dogs Eyes and Miniguns that night too), also The Fritz and Big Something in Roanoke

Other random facts/stats:
Thes month was my first time at only 1 of the 9 venues I went to.
This month was my first time seeing 28/45 bands I saw perform live.
Avg shows per week for 2015: 3.02
Days/Shows ratio for 2015 so far: 2.32:1
